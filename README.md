# Image processing techniques
Image processing techniques and basic computer vision tasks for accomplishing this. Implementing image processing operations involves applying various algorithms and techniques to manipulate digital images. These operations can be performed using programming languages and libraries specifically designed for image processing, such as Python with libraries like OpenCV.Operations covered here are:

1. Filtering: Filtering operations are used to enhance or remove specific features in an image. Common filtering techniques include Gaussian blur, median filtering, and edge detection.

2. Transformation: Image transformation operations involve changing the spatial or color characteristics of an image. Examples include scaling, rotation, and flipping.

3. Segmentation: Image segmentation involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects. Techniques like thresholding, region growing, and clustering can be used to perform segmentation.

4. Feature extraction: Feature extraction operations aim to extract relevant information or features from an image. This can involve detecting edges, corners, or other distinctive patterns within the image.

5. Morphological operations: Morphological operations are used to modify the shape or structure of objects in an image. Common morphological operations include dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.

6. Image restoration: Image restoration techniques are used to recover or improve the quality of degraded images. This can involve removing noise, reducing blurring, or enhancing contrast.

7. Image compression: Image compression operations aim to reduce the size of an image while preserving its visual quality. Techniques like JPEG and PNG compression are commonly used for this purpose.

Overall, implementing image processing operations requires a solid understanding of image processing concepts, familiarity with programming languages and libraries, and the ability to select and apply appropriate algorithms and techniques for the desired image manipulation tasks.
